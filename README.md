This project is a simple Post CRUD application built with Vue 3, utilizing the Composition API and Laravel 8. I've divided the components into composable and main components. Composables serve a role similar to service classes in Laravel. The application demonstrates how to manage posts, including functionalities such as creation, reading, updating, and deletion. It leverages Vue.js for the frontend and Laravel for the backend.
